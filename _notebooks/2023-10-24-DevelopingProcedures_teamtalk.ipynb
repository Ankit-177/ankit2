    "- Procedure Parameters: variables that are defined within the procedure's parentheses and serve as placeholders for values that can be passed to the procedure when it is called, allowing the procedure to operate on different data or values each time it is executed.\n",
    "- Procedure Algorithms: a step-by-step set of instructions that defines a specific task or operation to be performed within a computer program\n",
