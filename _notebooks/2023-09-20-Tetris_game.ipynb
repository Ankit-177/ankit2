    "# Additions made:\n",
    "- We created a new block and implemented it into our game. This was especially tricky, as the code was originally designed to contain only 7 types of blocks. However, we were able to add a new colour to the colour codes in the list, which enabled us to succesfully integrate an 8th block. Furthermore, we added a completely new scoring system to the game, refining the user experience and adding a sense of competition."
