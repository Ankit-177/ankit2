        - Perhaps talk about how some of the code works (ChatGPT review)?

- Linux and interaction in VSCode: (Unsure what this means).
- Python and interaction in VSCode: Present in the Python emoji print, Python mean algorithm and Python quiz hacks.
 
> Talk further about:
- Talk about how we needed to create a completely new repository, and how that helped with our knowledge of file management, movement of files from one VSCode project to another, and the anatomy and functionalities of Github.
- Review tickets have been built for each week to give a summary of accomplishments to accelerate our discussion. Go over each of these review tickets briefly.
- Go through lab notebooks and explain the errors that we encountered and how we fixed them.
- Show that Time Box has been updated with all plans, hacks and tangibles.

> Show additional work done.
