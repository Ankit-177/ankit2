### Summary of Accomplishments
> Updated Blog to contain all hacks.  
- This week, I created a new repository using the template from the public `student` repository from `nighthawkcoders`.
    - This new repository contained all the new updates from Mr. Mortensen. The `csse.md`, `csp.md`, and `csa.md` files got replaced by `compsci.md`. This was later renamed to 'Lab Notebook'.
- I updated personal home page along with finishing touches. I will probably do more with this later.
- The maintenance of plans, hacks and tangibles is visible in the Lab Notebook, which has been renamed to 'Time Box'. There is a clear organization of the work by week.
- I utilized outside resources to learn tricks in Markdown and HTML.
- There is continued awareness and use of Slack, especially in `#announcements` and `#general`.
- Toggled AutoSave on to ensure saved work when committing changes to Github. There is also a continued demonstration of version control in my personal repository.
- The theme has remained the same. In my opinion, Midnight looks the best. Perhaps this could change in the future?
