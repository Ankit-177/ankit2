# Learnings:
- How to properly sync my website with Github and deploy it on `github.io`. 
- How front matter affects a file and the way it is displayed in my website.
- The uses of JavaScript in creating big projects like the calculator, Classic Snake Game and the JavaScript API table of data using `jquery`.
- Some Python tricks that I can implement into my website for convenience/project purposes.

# Errors:
- The deployment of my website on `github.io` was not working. To fix the issue, I changed the owner name, Github username and baseurl in `_config.yml` to match my personal Github/repository information. This enabled the succesful deployment of my website on `github.io`.
