## Learnings/improvements over the entire trimester:
- Iterations (loops)
- If/else logic statements
- Defining and using functions
- Using libraries in Python
- AWS deployment
- Using the Nighthawk Coding Society Ubuntu server
- Using an API to retrieve information from a database (`fetch` command in JavaScript)
- Using lists and dictionaries
- Creating tables in JavaScript HTML DOM
- Using the internet and ChatGPT to aid with my learning and identifying complicated errors
- Using a database (third-party)
- Using CSS for styling
- Completing live reviews (improved presentation skills)
- Teaching computer science content to the entire class (improved teaching skills)
- Collaboration with a 4-member team

## Major accomplishments:
- Completed a passion project called "BookBattles":
    - The passion project included 95 books categorized by fiction and non-fiction, and further categorized by genre. Users could view these books in a table, where an API was used to retrieve book information from a third-party database and display it by column in a table created using JavaScript. There was a premature rating system that allowed users to rate books by clicking on stars (1-5). There was a section where users could find new books to read and go on a "Blind Book Date" where book titles were randomly generated, making it easier for a user to pick up a new book.
- Finished multiple live reviews showing progress and learning.
- Taught the class about data abstraction in our team teach lesson.
- Making plenty of commits on Github for both my personal blog and the passion project.
- Created games like Tic-Tac-Toe and Tetris using Python.

## Trimester 1 memories:
- Our team regularly met online on Zoom to work on our passion project.
- Got to know a lot of people through CS.
- Spoke to and created connections with my teachers.
- Succesfully participated in Night at the Museum (N@TM)

## Reflections:
- I believe the learning and experience from this trimester of AP Computer Science Principles have prepared me for the next two trimesters in terms of teacher expectations, team expectations, effective collaboration, organization, responsibility and quality of work. Furthermore, the CS content that I have been exposed to this trimester could prove to be benificial in the future, as CS is becoming an integral part of everday life in today's world; tomorrow's world will surely be more CS-dependant.
