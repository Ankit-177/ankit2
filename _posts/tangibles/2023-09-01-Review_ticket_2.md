### Summary of Accomplishments
> Integrating major JavaScript/Python projects into the Lab Notebook.
- This week, I helped others create new repositories from the public `student` repository in `nighthawkcoders`. 
- I got my website running on `github.io`. I initially encountered issues, but re-cloning my new repository into VSCode seemed to be the fix.
- I edited the front matter for all files in `_posts` and `_notebooks` to match the front matter found in `README.md`. 
- I also integrated JavaScript projects like the calculator, Classic Snake Game, and the JavaScript API table of data into my website. These projects can be found in the Time Box under Week 2.
- I moved the `assets` directory from the teacher repository into my personal repository to implement the dependancies of the calculator project. This made the calculator user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing.
- Python tricks like the emoji print were also integrated, and can be found in the Time Box under week 2.
