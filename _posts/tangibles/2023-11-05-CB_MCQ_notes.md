# Notes:
- Phishing: the fraudulent practice of sending emails or other messages purporting to be from reputable companies in order to induce individuals to reveal personal information, such as passwords and credit card numbers.

- Citizen science: the collection and analysis of data relating to the natural world by members of the general public, typically as part of a collaborative project with professional scientists.

- Internet Engineering Task Force: The Internet Engineering Task Force is a standards organization for the Internet and is responsible for the technical standards that make up the Internet protocol suite. It has no formal membership roster or requirements and all its participants are volunteers.

- Redundant routing: Redundant routing is a network design approach that involves creating multiple paths for data transmission between source and destination. By having redundant routes, telecom networks can ensure uninterrupted connectivity even if one or more routes experience failures or disruptions

- Lossy and lossless transformation: In data compression, lossy and lossless are two categories of data compression methods. The main difference between the two is that lossless compression restores and rebuilds the data in its original form after decompression, while lossy compression does not restore the data in its original form
    - Trick: Loss(less) = no loss of data; (loss)y = loss of data

- Floating-point representation: In computing, floating-point representation is a method of representing real numbers in a way that can support a wide range of values. Floating-point numbers are represented in scientific notation.

- Open standards and protocols: Open standards and protocols allow different manufacturers and developers to build hardware and software that can communicate with hardware and software on the rest of the network.

- NAND gate: A NAND gate is a type of logic gate that produces an output of false only when both of its two inputs are true.

- Undecidable problem: an undecidable problem is a decision problem for which it is proved to be impossible to construct an algorithm that always leads to a correct yes-or-no answer.
    - The halting problem (as seen in the MCQ) is an example: it can be proven that there is no algorithm that correctly determines whether an arbitrary program eventually halts when run.

- Symmetric encryption: Symmetric encryption is a type of encryption where only one key (a secret key) is used to both encrypt and decrypt electronic data. The entities communicating via symmetric encryption must exchange the key so that it can be used in the decryption process.

- Cloud computing: the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.


# Mistakes and score:
