### Summary of Accomplishments:
> Web Programming Basic tests.
- Finished the HTML portion of the Web Programming Basic tests.
- Finished the JavaScript Data Types portion of the Web Programming Basic tests.
- Finished the Document Object Model (DOM) portion of the Web Programming Basic tests.
- Finished the JavaScript number comparision portion of the Web Programming Basic tests.    

# Self-grading for Web Programming Basic tests:

### Each hack:
- 0.5 point: Have a working HTML code cell in a notebook based on the wireframe representation provided under HTML hacks (HTML Hack).
    - +0.47 point: The HTML code cell is functioning properly, with all, text, relevant button links, and additional image links working correctly.
- 0.5 point: Have a working javascript code cell in a notebook which creates, manipulates, and logs an object (Data Types Hack).
    - +0.46 point: The object is created with 7 key whose values are arrays of some type. The original object is printed, after which the manipulations to the string/number arrays are made and printed accordingly. There are also 2 mathematical calculations. Finally, the type of three different arrays are identified and printed.
- 0.5 point: Have a working javascript code cell in a notebook which modifies elements in the first HTML code cell hack or another HTML code cell based on the same wireframe representation (DOM Hack).
    - +0.47 point: The links of the multiple "a" tags in my original HTML code change when the button at the top is pressed. Additionally, the top paragraph now displays "Switched!".
- 0.5 point: Have a working javascript code cell in a notebook which compares two variables (Javascript Hack).
    - 0.45 point: The code succesfully compares two pre-determined variables, which in this case are the number of UEFA Champions League titles won by two of the all-time most successful teams in the tournament (Real Madrid and AC Milan).
- 0.5 point: Have code cells in a notebook which shows the corrections made to the first three code cells in the 1.4 correcting errors page (Correcting Errors Hack).
    - 0.47 point: All 3 code segments are corrected and include a thorough description of the changes made and why. Additionally, the BELOW NOT EDITED code segment is corrected with explanations as well.

### Reviews and Scoring:
- 1 point: Have all of the different notebooks and cells made working in their own individual GitHub Pages with utterances and reviewers comments.
    - +1 point: All required notebooks/code cells are functioning properly. Each hack has its own individual Github pages with utterances and reviewers comments.
- 0.5 point: Make a summary review ticket based on the Total Test and utterances. Have a total of the other peopleâ€™s scores that they collaborated with on the test.
