# Learnings:
- Collaboration with a group of 4. We learnt how to divide tasks effectively and frequently communicate to ensure efficiency in our work.
- We learnt how to solve problems as a group by debugging the Tetris Classic game and running it correctly.

# Errors:
- I did not have `pygame` installed when I tried to run the Tetric Classic game. This resulted in a `SystemExit`. To fix the error, I downloaded `pygame` by running `pip install pygame` in the VSCode terminal.
