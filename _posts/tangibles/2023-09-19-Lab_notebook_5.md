# Learnings:
- Collaboration with a group of 4: We learnt how to divide tasks effectively and frequently communicate to ensure efficiency in our work.
- We learnt how to solve problems as a group by debugging the Tetris Classic game and running it correctly.
- I learnt how to draw logic diagrams for a program. In doing so for the Team Test, I understood the deeper functionalities of the Tetris Classic game and learnt how to create logical connections between different parts of the code.
- We learnt how to properly document a program by utilizing hashtags within the code itself and creating separate markdown code cells to explain a snippet of code.

# Errors:
- I did not have `pygame` installed when I tried to run the Tetric Classic game. This resulted in a `SystemExit`. To fix the error, I downloaded `pygame` by running `pip install pygame` in the VSCode terminal.
- We utilized ChatGPT to fix a few strange errors that did not seem to have a fix at first. We later learnt that these errors were probably because of the copying and pasting of the code from an online source, which could have resulted in some bizarre indentation errors.
