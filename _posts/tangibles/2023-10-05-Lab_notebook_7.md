# Learnings:
- Data structures team lesson notes:
    - Variables: An abstraction inside a program that can hold value/store information.
    - Data Types: A data type is a type of variable, and these are the main types:
        - integer: a mathematical number
        - boolean: a yes/no statement
        - string (or text): for any text-based variable (including phone numbers)
        - lists: an ordered sequence of elements (elements can be strings/integers)
            - List index: Each elements of a string is referenced by an index:
                - In reality, list indexes start from 0
                - For the AP exam, list indexes start from 1
    - To convert data types to and from JSON, use this command:
        - `json.dumps`

# Errors:
