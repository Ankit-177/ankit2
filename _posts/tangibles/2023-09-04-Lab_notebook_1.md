# Learnings:
- How to start from scratch and create a new repository using a template. This was done in order to include all the updates made by Mr. Mortensen for the student website interface.
- How to maintain a lab notebook that logs your progress, weekly hacks, and tangibles where you write about your accomplished tasks and learnings.
- Additional tricks to edit the home page and make it look better.
- Editing `_config.yml` to change the theme of my wesbite.
- The anatomy of Github pages.
- The installation/setup and uses of Linux Shell and Bash.
- The uses and rough sytax of JavaScript as seen in projects like the calculator, Classic Snake Game and JavaScript API table of data using `jquery`. 

# Errors:
- There were no major errors. However, there was a small mistake. When creating this new repository, I forgot to clone and open it using WSL. To fix the 'issue', I had to use `git clone [repository link]` in Windows Powershell and then open the repository in VSCode.
