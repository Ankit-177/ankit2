### Welcome to the first lab notebook entry!
# Learnings:
- The functionalities of Terminal/Windows Powershell and their uses in installing development tools.
- The purpose of Windows Subsystem for Linux, or WSL.
- Reviewed additional Markdown/HTML tricks online and refreshed my HTML knowledge.
- Learnt about Github and how it stores files and folders for a project in a 'repository'.

# Errors:
- Forgot `sudo apt upgrade` during tools (Jupyter, Ruby, Python3), Ruby did not install. Ran `sudo apt upgrade` later to fix and install properly.
- (#) in line #7 for Makefile to fix `bundle install` not running.
- Error `mdless not found` during Linux Shell setup for last code cell. Ran `gem install mdless` in VSCode terminal to fix the issue.
