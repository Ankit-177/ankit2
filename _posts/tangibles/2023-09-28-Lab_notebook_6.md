# Learnings:
- I learnt HTML and the simple, easy-to-understand Syntax. I found that HTML can be used for creating things like buttons and linked images for any website.
- I learnt about data types in JavaScript. These data types include strings, numbers, arrays and objects.
- I learnt about Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript. DOM in JavaScript refers to a programming interface for web documents. It can be edited to change the document structure, style, and content.
- I learnt about number comparision in JavaScript, with the syntax being quite straightforward.
- I also learnt about debugging code, especially in JavaScript.

# Errors:
- There were no major errors. The only errors that occured while completing the Web Programming Basic tests were variable mismatches and typos.
