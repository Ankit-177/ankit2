# Learnings:
- The uses and importance of Github issues. Github issues can be used to log plans, bugs, to-do lists and much more. It helps with the organization of your thoughts. 
- The planning process for a techical showcase.

# Errors:
- The `github.io` link for my website was not displaying any `.ipynb` files along with their auto-generated `.md` files in my Time Box. To fix this, I made a few edits to `2023-08-28-quiz.ipynb`, ran `make clean` to regenerate `2023-08-23-quiz_IPYNB_2.md`, and committed/pushed the changes to Github. This made them re-appear like normal.
