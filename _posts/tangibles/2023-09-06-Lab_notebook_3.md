# Learnings:
- The uses and importance of Github issues. Github issues can be used to log plans, bugs, to-do lists and much more. It helps with the organization of your thoughts. 
- The planning process for a techical showcase.
- Fetching information and displaying results from a third-party API. The user is able to input search term(s) through an interactive user interface and recieve results from the Wikipedia API and YouTube API. This method is applicable to most other third-party APIs (Facebook, Google, etc.).

# Errors:
- The `github.io` link for my website was not displaying any `.ipynb` files along with their auto-generated `.md` files in my Time Box. To fix this, I made a few edits to `2023-08-28-quiz.ipynb`, ran `make clean` to regenerate `2023-08-23-quiz_IPYNB_2.md`, and committed/pushed the changes to Github. This made them re-appear like normal.
