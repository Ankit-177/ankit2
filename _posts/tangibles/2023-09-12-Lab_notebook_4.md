# Learnings:
- How to utilize lists, dictionaries and while loops in creating a quiz using Python. We stored our questions in a dictionary and utilized while loops to ask the questions and prompt the user for their inputs/answers. The while loop also displayed whether the inputted answer was right or wrong.
    - We stored the answers in another dictionary and included multiple iterations of the answers with different case and formatting to ensure that almost any relevant inputted answer is recognized as correct.
- Creating an information database using Python and utilizing for loops, while loops and recursion to print the output in the same manner.
