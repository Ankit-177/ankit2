# Learnings:
- How to utilize lists, dictionaries and while loops in creating a quiz using Python. We stored our questions in a dictionary and utilized while loops to ask the questions and prompt the user for their inputs/answers. The while loop also displayed whether the inputted answer was right or wrong.
    - We stored the answers in another dictionary and included multiple iterations of the answers with different case and formatting to ensure that almost any relevant inputted answer is recognized as correct.
- Creating an information database using Python and utilizing for loops, while loops and recursion to print the output in the same manner.
- From the CollegeBoard video: Types of errors and how to fix them. The error types mentioned in the video were logic errors, overflow errors, syntax errors and runtime errors. The video walked me through how to identify and fix these errors with relevant examples.

# Errors:
- No major errors. I did mismatch a few variables in the new quiz code which resulted in a runtime error, which I fixed immediately.
