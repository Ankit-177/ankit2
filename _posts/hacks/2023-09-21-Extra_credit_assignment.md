# Takeaways:
- Knowledge from CSP can be highly beneficial in college. For example, one of the panellists mentioned that their experiences in CSP helped with MATLAB and scripting classes. Additionally, Agile and Github were crucial tools that aided in college as well.
- Even if you do not want to do a pure computer science major in college or fail to get into a CS major specifically, there are many other fields outside of pure CS that still heavily utilize computer science. An example provided by one of the panellists was the field of cognitive sciences, where computer science is vital even though the field is related to something quite different. Therefore, computer science knowledge and experience in general can be highly beneficial for most majors available in college.
- Computer science knowledge and experience can greatly help your chances of landing a good internship. Most competitive internship applications involve interviews where your computer science knowledge will be tested.
- There are plenty of CS-related extracurriculars that can boost your resume. Some examples include teaching programming, freelance web development, community projects or event organization.
- Personal/community projects are huge when it comes to applying for internships or college itself. Make sure that your projects actually have a tangible output in terms of helping a company/organization or creating a positive impact in society. This shows that you have actually applied your knowledge in building a project rather than just stating that you have experience in computer science.

# Reflection:
- I think this session opened my eyes in terms of how vital computer science really is in todayâ€™s world. Listening to the great examples given by the panellists, I now see how important computer science skills and experiences can be in the real world. They can greatly help with college, internships at big companies, or even landing a proper job offer.
- CS can open doors to many other fields of study. Given how technology-dependent most things are today, knowledge and experience in CS can prove to be highly beneficial, as seen in the real-world examples provided by the panellists. This motivated me to further my knowledge as much as possible by working hard and taking some time on my own to learn new things or polish my skills.
- With the right resources and tools, learning CS can be made quick and efficient as seen in some of the examples provided by the panelists. This shows that with dedication and a drive to learn, anybody can learn and utilize CS, be it for personal use or internship/job applications.
- Learning CS can also teach crucial life skills such as patience, creativity, effective communication and collaboration. Even if you decide not to go into a CS-related field in the future, the skills and values you learn through CS or a course such as CSP can prove to be beneficial no matter where you go in life.
